# RedditDM-Automation
a mobile automation program to automate the process of DM-ing users on reddit

# How to Use
there are two parts in this repository:
- scraping usernames
- dm-ing the username

you can customise the scraping tool as per your wish using the reddit API. by default, it'll scrape all the usernames of reddit users that participated on the newest posts on the target subreddit of your choice. the dm automation program would open reddit on your mobile phone and search for the username, start a chat and send the message. you can customise the message and modify/add any other features.

# Requirements
the requirements for using this are:
- ADB on your system
(also you need to use your mobile phone in the developer mode)

PS: the actions in the above code are customised as per to the requirements of my mobile phone. you will need to change them to fit that on yours before you can automate any process.
